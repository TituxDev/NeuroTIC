C-based Data-Oriented Artificial Neural Network SDK

**NeuroTIC** helps you design, build, train, save, and load networks with complete creative control over their topology—without dragging you through the usual low-level chores.

## About the framework

**NeuroTIC** offers a modular environment where every part of a neural network—layers, neurons, activation flows, learning rules, serialization—is open and accessible.

The design is intentionally minimal: you get a clean API for common tasks, but nothing is hidden.
