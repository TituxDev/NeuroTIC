# NeuroTIC

**NeuroTIC** is a minimalist neural network library in C, for those who like their code raw, their terminals dark, and their neurons interconnected manually. Think of it as soldering logic gates together... but with pointers.

## Overview

This project began as a spark of curiosity — a desire to truly understand how AI works from the ground up. The challenge: build it using nothing but pure C, with no external libraries or frameworks.

It all started with XOR. Once that classic hurdle was overcome, the need for custom tools to create and connect neurons became inevitable. From there, NeuroTIC began to evolve into a modular, hackable neural network library — lightweight, low-level, and entirely under your control.

If you are interested to know how this code growth there is a site (in spanish) where I explain the process from scratch [NeuroTIClab](https://neuroticlab.com)
