# NeuroTIC Philosophy 🎓

NeuroTIC is not just a tool — it's an experiment in clarity, control, and curiosity. Built on principles of transparency and education, it reflects a unique perspective on how neural systems can be built from scratch.

## Guiding Principles

- 🔍 **Understand before you abstract**  
Grasp the core mechanics before hiding them behind layers of code.
- 🛠️ **Build it yourself**  
If you construct it, you'll know how and why it breaks.
- 📦 **No dependencies, no magic**  
Pure C, malloc, and explicit logic. Know what’s running.
- 🧑‍💻 **Respect and transparency**  
Open source means mutual respect between author and user.
- 🎓 **Made for learning and hacking**  
This is a lab for ideas — educational, low-level, and open-ended.

NeuroTIC is for those who love hacking systems at the byte level, understanding neural mechanics like they would understand a circuit board, and seeing learning as an experiment rather than a product.
