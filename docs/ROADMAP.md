# NeuroTIC Roadmap 🛣️

A list of current goals and features in development for the project.

## ✅ Completed

- 🧠 Core neuron struct with inputs, weights, biases, activation functions
- 🔗 Flexible network struct with dynamic topology and inter-neuron buffers
- 🏗️ Build & train feedforward networks from scratch
- 💾 Save/load trained networks to binary files
- 🛠️ memtrack library for safe and automatic memory management
- 📚 Initial documentation, examples, and companion site
- 🏋️ Full backpropagation implementation with working training routines
- 🧩 Scripts & Makefiles for easy compilation and example execution

## 🔜 In Progress / Planned

- 🔌 Simplified API for creating buffer connections (generic connector function)
- 🧪 Tools for unit testing, network validation, and debugging
- 📊 Training visualization (CLI-based)
- 📁 Refactor library code for multi-platform support
- ⚙️ Plugin-style support for additional activation functions
- 🧯 Internal safety checks, input validation, and robust error handling
- 🌐 APIs for other languages (Python/C++ integration)
- 📝 Extended documentation & tutorials for beginners
- 🚀 Support for loading training data from files or external sensors
