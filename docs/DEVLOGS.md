# NeuroTIC Dev Log 🧠

The journey from a single XOR problem to a fully hackable neural network toolkit.

1. 🤔 AI isn’t just nested ifs… how does it work?
2. 🖥️ Boolean perceptron coded, AND works.
3. 🧮 Weights, biases, error — adjustments automated.
4. ❌ XOR unsolvable at first… challenge accepted.
5. ➕ More neurons needed.
6. 🏋️ Training a full network… learning derivatives.
7. 🛠️ Built flexible structs for neurons & networks.
8. 🔌 Connections like electrical wiring: inputs as pointers, outputs as variables.
9. 🕸️ Any topology possible with dynamic memory.
10. 🧼 Buffers added to respect memory space.
11. 💡 “Aha!” moments: flow of info in perceptrons, combining neurons for XOR.
12. 💪 No step too big, every problem solvable.
13. 📂 Libraries & helper scripts make the system organized.
14. 🧩 Pointers & buffers prevent memory explosion.
15. 🔄 memtrack handles tricky memory freeing.
16. 💾 Saving networks: binary files, endianness, IEEE floats.
17. 🐛 Bugs: sneaky double-free caught after memory optimization.
18. ⚡ Pure C power: speed, control, flexibility.
19. 🎉 Pride: flexible networks, beginner-friendly, fully hackable.
20. 🔧 Next: generic buffer connections, training from files/sensors, wild topologies.
